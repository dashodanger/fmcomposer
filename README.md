# Why
Modern world lacks modern trackers. There is very few custom FM engines in the VST market, most of them are emulating old existing hardware.
This is a attempt to make a good yet minimalistic FM synthesizer, with a very graphical, easy to use interface.
This is also an attempt to provide real time sound synthesis for video games. Since the FM engine is a separate module with very few dependencies, it can be intergrated into other projects. Playback with real time modification of the song is possible for interactive content.

# Technical overview
GUI is written in C++ and using the SFML library to get low level access to the display, keyboard and mouse input. Each GUI element has its class. They are used by Views which are the actual program screens (Pattern screen, Instrument screen, Settings etc.). Views, for most of them, contain everything they need for providing the features to the user. This results in quite big classes, which are split in several files for readability.

The audio engine is written in pure C and was optimized for lowest CPU usage possible (cache-friendly structures, loops on small data sets, no function calls in critical parts, taking advantage of unsigned int wrapping for phase accumulators and so on). A part of the optimization relies on the use of FISTP instruction instead of the standard C ftol() for int/float conversions.

FM Composer uses its own binary format, FMCI for storing instruments and .FMCS for the songs . They use LZ4 compression (https://github.com/lz4/lz4).

# Compiling
For Unix builds, you'll need the following additional libraries :
- SFML 2
